# Work Experience

My work interests vary between software engineering, hardware engineering, and robotics. I'm also flexible with working in either an established company or a startup.

    <p> The startup bridging hardware and software founded in the wake of covid, working on post-pandemic technologies. We originally started with a P2P contact tracer, Coronaware, which we pitched to NHSx and other government officials. After this project, we worked on a digital dashboard to accelerate the handover process at hospitals.</p>

    <h2>Imperial College London</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Along with the StudentsShapers team (6 students), we built from scratch a scalable virtual world platform that will support students joining remotely
        next year from both and educational and social perspectives.
      </li>
      <li>
        The world, a realistic replica of Imperial campus, was generated using Minecraft, while using our custom servers and plugins to support lecture rooms
        linked to Microsoft Teams, interactive quizzes, 3D audio chat, admin control, and public implication in extending the world.
      </li>
      <li>The overall system is secured and horizontally scalable to support a few thousand students. It is live and ran a 300 students event.</li>

    <h1>Software Engineering Intern</h1>
    <h2>Schlumberger</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The task was to prototype a Drilling Program quick-look Progressive Web App (PWA), that will enable drilling engineers to review their reports faster and securely, in any network conditions (slow or offline), on any device (desktop or mobile). This PWA prototype would be an extension of Reporting, one of DrillPlanâ€™s fundamental tools (a Schlumberger software), as well as a research into building simple, yet effective cross-platform applications
      </li>
      <li>
        The team was satisfied with the delivered prototype. It was therefore deployed on production servers and is currently accessible by Schlumberger DrillPlan clients. Further investigation is required to support new customizations and features, as well as define diverse limitations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, it was a great experience. Beside learning new technologies, I have developped new work ethics within the Schlumberger supportive and professional environment as well as linked Software Engineering to real-world applications in a large corporate.
