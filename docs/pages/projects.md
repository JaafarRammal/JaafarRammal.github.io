## Real-Time Vocals filter

<small>Jan 2021 - Apr 2021</small>

This project was part of Year 3 Real-Time Digital Signal Processing at Imperial College, and was done in pairs with Karl-Kareem Melaimi. The goal was to explore a solution that would make use of a DSP board (TMS320F28379D) to filter vocals from music in real-time.

## IOT: Internet Of Trash

<small>Jan 2021 - Apr 2021</small>

This project was part of Year 3 Embed Systems at Imperial College, and was done in a group of 4. The goal was build a real-life solution for a problem of our choice using IOT technologies. We decided to build iCleen, a network of smart bins with an interactive dashboard to optimize the trash collection in cities and real-time monitoring of trash volumes and any hazardous fires. More details can be found on the [project page](https://eie-jedis.web.app) (with details about the collaborators).

## Music synthesiser

<small>Jan 2021 - Apr 2021</small>

This project was part of Year 3 Embed Systems at Imperial College, and was done in a group of 4. The goal was to explore real-time systems by building a music synthesiser. Our final deliverable supported advanced features such as track recording and overlay, polyphone, varying BPM, and multiple instruments. More details can be found on the [project page](https://raii-baby.web.app) (with details about the collaborators).

## Hardware Accelerator

<small>Jan 2021 - Apr 2021</small>

This project was part of Year 3 Digital System Design at Imperial College, and was done in pairs with Marian Lukac. The goal was to design a hardware accelerator for a complex mathematical function, which involved CORDIC, pipelining, DMA, and other hardware concepts on a Cyclone V FPGA. You can learn more by checking our [project report](https://www.jaafarrammal.com/assets/projects/dsd.pdf).

## MIPS-C Compiler

<small>Jan 2020 - Apr 2020</small>

This project was part of Year 2 Language Processors at Imperial College, and was done in pairs with Raphael Bijaoui. The goal was to build a C to Python translator as well as a C to MIPS compiler. We used Java and ANTLR to build both, implementing 95% of the required C90 features. More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/JaafarRammal/EE2-Compiler).

## MIPS Simulator

<small>Oct 2019 - Dec 2019</small>

This project was part of Year 2 Computer Architecture at Imperial, and was done in pairs with Maelle Guerre. The goal was to build a MIPS simulator using C, where you can feed the simulator assembly inputs and it would, well, simulate the behavior of a MIPS CPU. We used solid OOP practices and abstractions, as well as unit tests. More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/JaafarRammal/Pineapple_MIPS_19_20).

## Interactive Flappy Bird on FPGA

<small>Apr 2019 - Jun 2019</small>

This project was part of Year 1 Final Year Project at Imperial, and was done in a group of 3 with Maelle Guerre and Victor Florea. We built a real-time image processing module on an FPGA which was able to detect the flap motion (with the hands) of a person standing in front of the screen / camera. The flaps would then be used to control the bird character in a custom-built version of flappy bird.

## Jafadrian ISA

<small>Jan 2020</small>

This project was a 12 hours challenge Adrian, Chris, and I set, where we built a simple RISC CPU on an FPGA with a custom 16-bit ISA. The ISA includes a nice instruction to control IO (which can be extended to screen, buttons, and potentially VGA) alongside a simple parser / assembler for our assembly. The parser generates a RAM config which is then uploaded to the board as the instruction cache. The CPU has a 2 stages pipeline (which is really just fetch / execute). More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/JaafarRammal/Jafadrian-ISA).

## Steganography for iOS

<small>Mar 2018</small>

This project was part of a CS course at high school, done in pairs with Sami Harakeh. We built an iOS app which allowed people to hide messages inside pictures with an optional password and decode them at the receiving end. More details can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/JaafarRammal/iOS-Steganography). (will upload demo and slides once I find them, they are somewhere in my archives).
