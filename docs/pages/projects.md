## Real-Time Vocals filter

This project was part of Year 3 Real-Time Digital Signal Processing at Imperial College, and was done in pairs with Karl-Kareem Melaimi. The goal was to explore a solution that would make use of a DSP board (TMS320F28379D) to filter vocals from music in real-time. You can learn more by checking our [project report](https://www.jaafarrammal.com/assets/projects/rtdsp.pdf).

## IOT: Internet Of Trash

This project was part of Year 3 Embed Systems at Imperial College, and was done in a group of 4. The goal was build a real-life solution for a problem of our choice using IOT technologies. We decided to build iCleen, a network of smart bins with an interactive dashboard to optimize the trash collection in cities and real-time monitoring of trash volumes and any hazardous fires.

## Music synthesiser

This project was part of Year 3 Embed Systems at Imperial College, and was done in a group of 4. The goal was to explore real-time systems by building a music synthesiser. Our final deliverable supported advanced features such as track recording and overlay, polyphone, varying BPM, and multiple instruments. More details can be found on the [project page](https://raii-baby.web.app). You can also [view the demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zuwbCWyY9g).

## Hardware Accelerator

This project was part of Year 3 Digital System Design at Imperial College, and was done in pairs with Marian Lukac. The goal was to design a hardware accelerator for a complex mathematical function, which involved CORDIC, pipelining, DMA, and other hardware concepts on a Cyclone V FPGA.
